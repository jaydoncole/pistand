Digital Music Stand

This is just a simple project I used to learn Python. This is a digital music stand made to run on a Raspberry Pi.

Currently, songs are looked for in a "Music" folder placed in root directory of the program, ordered in subfolders of Artist > Album > Song. Currently sheet music must be in .png format. 

Hardcoded things abound, you'll probably need to make modifications to use it yourself.
